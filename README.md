ArchiveBot checks designated categories every time a message is sent in one of the channels.
When a message is sent in one of the channels ArchiveBot will check each channel under the categories and see if the last message sent was within a given time frame. If so, the channel stays/is sent to the active channel category, otherwise it stays/is sent to the archived category.
